\subsection{Final Similarity Score}

The final similarity score is calculated using weighted combination of semantic analysis and enhanced word overlap:

\begin{equation}
FSS = (Semantic\_Score \times 0.7) + (Overlap\_Score \times 0.3)
\end{equation}

Where $FSS$ combines semantic analysis and enhanced word overlap methods with weights 0.7 and 0.3 respectively.
