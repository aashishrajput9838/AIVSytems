AI-generated responses in sensitive domains often fail to provide transparent reasoning validation, creating trust gaps and increasing the risk of misinformation. The issue becomes critical in healthcare, education, and legal sectors, where flawed reasoning can cause serious harm. Analysis of AI transparency studies and local case observations in India reveals the absence of a systematic method to verify AI reasoning accuracy in real time. The research presents an AI Response Reasoning Validation System that tracks AIâ€“user interactions, records model outputs, compares reasoning steps with factual data using semantic analysis and character n-gram similarity algorithms, and assigns an accuracy score to each response through enhanced word overlap matching with Levenshtein distance calculations. The developed prototype demonstrates early-stage accuracy of 95%, with scope for refinement. The system benefits AI developers, policymakers, researchers, and organizations deploying AI in high-stakes decisions. Future enhancements include multi-model compatibility, real-time fact-checking API integration, and adaptive learning for stronger reasoning verification across domains.
