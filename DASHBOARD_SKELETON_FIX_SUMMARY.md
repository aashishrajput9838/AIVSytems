# Dashboard CardSkeleton Import Fix

## Issue Identified

### Error Details
- **Error**: `ReferenceError: CardSkeleton is not defined`
- **Location**: `Dashboard.jsx:131:14`
- **Component**: Dashboard component
- **Impact**: Application crashes when trying to render Dashboard with loading state

### Root Cause
The Dashboard component was using `CardSkeleton` and `TableSkeleton` components without importing them from the UI components library.

## Fix Applied

### File Modified: `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
import { EnhancedSkeleton } from '@/shared/components/ui'
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { EnhancedSkeleton, CardSkeleton, TableSkeleton } from '@/shared/components/ui'
```

### Code Location
The error occurred in the loading state section of the Dashboard component:

```javascript
{/* Logs Table with Loading Skeleton */}
{isLoading ? (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <CardSkeleton showActions={false} />  // ← This was undefined
    <TableSkeleton rows={8} columns={5} />  // ← This was also undefined
  </div>
) : (
  <LogsTable
    logs={logs}
    formatTimestamp={formatTimestamp}
    approveLog={approveLog}
    rejectLog={rejectLog}
  />
)}
```

## Components Available

The following skeleton components are available in `@/shared/components/ui`:

- `CardSkeleton` - Card-style loading skeleton with title, description, and optional actions
- `TableSkeleton` - Table loading skeleton with configurable rows and columns
- `FormSkeleton` - Form loading skeleton with labels and inputs
- `NavigationSkeleton` - Navigation loading skeleton
- `StatsSkeleton` - Statistics/numbers loading skeleton
- `ListSkeleton` - List loading skeleton
- `ContentSkeleton` - Content loading skeleton
- `SearchSkeleton` - Search input loading skeleton
- `ProfileSkeleton` - Profile loading skeleton

## Expected Results

After applying the fix:
1. ✅ Dashboard component loads without errors
2. ✅ Loading skeletons display properly during data fetching
3. ✅ No more "CardSkeleton is not defined" errors
4. ✅ Error boundary no longer catches undefined component errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Loading State Test**:
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Verify loading skeletons appear during initial load
   - Check that skeletons have proper styling and animations

2. **Error Recovery Test**:
   - Verify Dashboard loads properly after the fix
   - Test error boundary functionality with other errors
   - Ensure no console errors related to undefined components

3. **Component Integration Test**:
   - Test all skeleton components are properly imported
   - Verify EnhancedSkeleton still works as expected
   - Check that all UI components are accessible

## Prevention Measures

1. **Import Validation**: Always verify imports when using new components
2. **TypeScript**: Consider migrating to TypeScript for better import checking
3. **ESLint Rules**: Add rules to catch undefined component usage
4. **Component Library**: Maintain clear documentation of available components

## Files Modified

- `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` - Added missing imports
