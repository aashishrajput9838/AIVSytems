# AIV Systems - Project Summary

## Project Overview
AIV Systems is a comprehensive AI Response Validation Platform that monitors, validates, and ensures the accuracy of AI model responses through advanced NLP algorithms, multi-source fact-checking, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Key Components

### 1. Chrome Extensions
Three versions of Chrome extensions provide different levels of validation:

#### Full Version
- Real-time validation of AI chatbot responses
- Integration with backend validation services
- Support for ChatGPT, Gemini, Groq, Claude, and Copilot
- Comprehensive validation results display

#### Local Validator
- Privacy-focused validation running entirely in-browser
- No external API calls or data transmission
- Built-in validation rules
- Works offline with zero data leaving the browser

#### Simple Version
- Basic functionality for minimal validation needs
- Lightweight implementation
- Easy to install and use

### 2. Web Application
A React-based dashboard for monitoring and analyzing AI response validation:

#### Features
- Real-time monitoring of AI responses
- Comprehensive dashboard with analytics
- Data visualization using Recharts
- CSV export functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Authentication with Firebase

#### Pages
- Home: Landing page with project overview
- Dashboard: Main validation interface
- How It Works: Process explanation
- Capabilities: System capabilities overview
- Insights: Analytics and data visualization
- About: Company information
- Contact: Contact form and information

### 3. Backend Services
Firebase Functions providing validation API endpoints:

#### Functions
- `validateAIResponse`: Validates AI responses using advanced algorithms
- `getValidations`: Retrieves validation results

#### Features
- Multi-validator approach with weighted scoring
- Entity recognition for different content types
- Factual accuracy checking via web search
- Risk assessment and flagging system

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with Vite build system
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** components
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Recharts** for data visualization

### Backend
- **Firebase Functions** for serverless backend
- **Firestore** for data storage
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management

### Chrome Extensions

## Architecture

### Chrome Extension Architecture
```
[AI Platforms] → [Content Scripts] → [Background Service] → [Validation API] → [Popup UI]
                            ↓
                    [Local Storage]
```

### Web Application Architecture
```
[Frontend] ↔ [Firebase Auth] ↔ [Firestore] ↔ [Firebase Functions]
```

### Data Flow
1. Content scripts monitor AI platforms for new responses
2. Background service sends responses to validation API
3. Firebase Functions apply validation algorithms
4. Results stored in Firestore
5. Popup and dashboard display validation results
6. Data processed for insights and visualization
