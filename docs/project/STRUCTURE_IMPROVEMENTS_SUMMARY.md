# AIV Systems - Structure Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the structural improvements made to the AIV Systems project to enhance maintainability, scalability, and developer experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Chrome Extension Structure

#### Before:
```

│   ├── content/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── debug/
│   ├── popup/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── utils/
└── docs/
```

#### After:
```
chrome-extension/
├── dist/                         # Built extension files for distribution
├── src/                          # Source code
│   ├── components/               # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── background/           # Background script components
│   │   ├── content/              # Content script components
│   │   ├── popup/                # Popup UI components
│   │   └── shared/               # Shared components between parts
│   ├── content/                  # Content scripts for AI platform integration
│   ├── core/                     # Core extension files (manifest, package.json)
│   ├── lib/                      # Shared libraries and utilities
│   ├── assets/                   # Static assets (icons, images)
│   └── utils/                    # Utility functions

├── pages/                        # Page components
├── services/                     # API services
├── shared/                       # Shared components and utilities
│   ├── components/               # Reusable UI components
│   ├── constants/                # Application constants
│   └── utils/                    # Utility functions
├── styles/                       # Global styles
├── types/                        # TypeScript types
