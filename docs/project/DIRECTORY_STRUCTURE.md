## File Organization Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Source code and built files are kept separate
- Different components are organized in dedicated directories
- Configuration files are kept in the root for easy access

### 2. Logical Grouping
- Related files are grouped together
- Documentation is organized by purpose and audience
- Scripts are categorized by function

### 3. Clear Naming Conventions
- Descriptive directory and file names
- Consistent naming patterns across the project
- Intuitive organization that reflects project structure

### 4. Scalability
- Structure supports easy addition of new features
- Modular organization allows for independent development
- Clear separation facilitates team collaboration

## Benefits of the Improved Structure

### 1. Improved Maintainability
- Clear directory structure makes files easy to locate
- Logical organization reduces complexity
- Better separation of concerns simplifies debugging

### 2. Enhanced Scalability
- Modular structure supports growth
- Clear organization allows for feature expansion
- Standardized structure facilitates team collaboration

### 3. Better Developer Experience
- Intuitive structure reduces onboarding time
- Well-organized documentation improves understanding
- Automated scripts streamline development workflow

### 4. Simplified Deployment
- Ready-to-package structure for distribution
- Clear distinction between development and production files
- Organized configuration files simplify deployment

## Best Practices

### 1. Adding New Files
- Place files in the appropriate directory based on their function
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Update documentation when adding significant features

### 2. Documentation
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Update documentation when making changes
- Use clear, descriptive names for documentation files

### 3. Build Process
- Use the provided build scripts for consistent builds
- Place built files in the appropriate distribution directories
- Test builds before creating distribution packages

### 4. Version Control
- Follow the .gitignore rules
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Keep the repository organized and clean

This structure provides a solid foundation for the continued development and maintenance of the AIV Systems project.
