# AIV Systems - Directory Restructuring Completion Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the successful completion of the directory restructuring project for the AIV Systems codebase. The project focused on improving the organization and maintainability of the project's directory structure through comprehensive reorganization.

## Project Objectives
1. **Improve Directory Organization** - Create a more logical and intuitive directory structure
2. **Enhance Maintainability** - Implement better separation of concerns and file organization
3. **Streamline File Management** - Organize files into appropriate categories
4. **Enhance Documentation** - Create comprehensive documentation for the new structure
5. **Ensure Scalability** - Design a structure that supports future growth

## Work Completed

### 1. Documentation Organization

#### Created New Documentation Categories
- **Architecture** (`docs/architecture/`) - System architecture and design documents
- **Build** (`docs/build/`) - Build process documentation and scripts
- **Deployment** (`docs/deployment/`) - Deployment guides and configuration
- **Project** (`docs/project/`) - Project management and summary documents

#### Moved Existing Documentation
- Moved project summary documents to `docs/project/`
- Moved architecture-related documents to `docs/architecture/`
- Organized existing documentation into appropriate categories

### 2. Distribution Files Organization

#### Created Packages Directory
- **Packages** (`packages/`) - Centralized location for all distribution files
- Moved all ZIP distribution files from root to `packages/`
- Organized release files for better version management

### 3. Script Files Organization

#### Created Batch Scripts Directory
- **Batch Scripts** (`scripts/batch/`) - Windows batch scripts for common tasks
- Moved all `.bat` files from root to `scripts/batch/`
- Organized utility scripts for better accessibility

#### Test Scripts Organization
- **Test Scripts** (`scripts/test/`) - Test scripts and utilities
- Consolidated test-related files in one location
- Maintained existing test file organization

### 4. Build Output Organization

#### Dist Directory
- **Distribution** (`dist/`) - Built web application files
- Reserved for build output from the main web application
- Maintained separation between source and built files
