# AIV Systems - Codebase Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the AIV Systems codebase to enhance its structure, organization, and maintainability.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Chrome Extension Structure Enhancement

#### Directory Reorganization
- **Created new `dist/` directory** for built extension files

  - `popup/` - Popup UI components
- **Centralized libraries** in `src/lib/` directory
- **Maintained clear separation** between source and distribution files

#### File Movement

- Created `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Overall project summary
- Updated `chrome-extension/README.md` - Extension-specific documentation

#### Documentation Organization
- Improved categorization of documentation files
- Added architecture and design documentation
- Enhanced installation and usage guides
- Created comprehensive project overview

### 4. Project Structure Standardization

#### Consistent Directory Naming
- Applied consistent naming conventions across all directories
- Used descriptive names for all components
- Maintained logical grouping of related files

#### Separation of Concerns
- Clear distinction between source code and built files
- Separated components by functionality
- Isolated shared libraries and utilities
- Organized test files appropriately

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Maintainability

### 4. Simplified Deployment
- Ready-to-package structure for Chrome extensions
- Automated build scripts reduce deployment errors
- Clear distinction between development and production files

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chrome Extension Build Process
1. **Source Directory**: `chrome-extension/src/`
2. **Distribution Directory**: `chrome-extension/dist/`
3. **Build Script**: `chrome-extension/build-extension.js`
4. **Key Components Copied**:
   - Core files (manifest.json, package.json)
   - Components (background, content, popup)
   - Content scripts
   - Libraries (validation service, Firebase config)
   - Utilities (debug utils)

### Web Application Build Process
1. **Source Directory**: `src/`
2. **Distribution Directory**: `dist/`
3. **Build Script**: `scripts/build-web.js`
4. **Key Components Copied**:
   - App root and routing
   - Feature modules
   - Shared components and utilities
   - Hooks, pages, services, styles, types, assets
