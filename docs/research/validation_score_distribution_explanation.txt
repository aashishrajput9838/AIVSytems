The validation score distribution chart demonstrates excellent performance of the AI response validation system, with a clear upward trend showing that the majority of responses achieve high validation scores. Out of 100 total responses tested, 40 responses (40%) achieved the highest scores in the 0.8-1.0 range, while only 5 responses (5%) fell into the lowest 0.0-0.2 range, indicating strong overall validation accuracy. The distribution shows a positive skew with 65 responses achieving scores above 0.6, suggesting that the semantic analysis and character n-gram algorithms effectively identify high-quality AI responses while minimizing false positives.
