3.2 Formulas

The validation system employs five core mathematical formulations to ensure comprehensive AI response assessment. The weighted overall validation score (Formula 1) combines multiple validator outputs using normalized scores and importance weights, enabling flexible prioritization of different validation criteria. Min-max normalization (Formula 2) standardizes raw metrics to [0,1] range, ensuring consistent scoring across diverse measurement scales. Factual accuracy via cosine similarity (Formula 3) quantifies semantic alignment between AI responses and reference sources using vector embeddings. The logistic regression model (Formula 4) determines external verification probability based on feature flags, triggering additional validation when confidence thresholds are exceeded. Exponential moving average (Formula 5) smooths temporal score variations for stable dashboard analytics, reducing noise while preserving trend information. These formulas collectively establish a robust mathematical framework for multi-dimensional AI response validation, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability in real-time assessment scenarios.
