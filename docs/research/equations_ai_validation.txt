Equations:

1. Weighted Validation Score Calculation:

VS = (Σ(wi × si)) / (Σwi)

Where,
• VS = Validation Score (0.0 to 1.0)
• wi = Weight of validator i
• si = Score of validator i
• Weights: error_keywords=0.2, response_length=0.1, sensitive_keywords=0.1, professional_claims=0.15, personal_relationship=0.2, personal_characteristic=0.15, factual_accuracy=0.45

2. Semantic Similarity (Character N-gram Jaccard):

SS = |Intersection| / |Union|

Where,
• |Intersection| = Number of common n-grams between texts
• |Union| = Total unique n-grams in both texts
• n-gram = Character sequences of length n (typically n=3)

3. Enhanced Word Overlap Similarity:

EWOS = (Exact_Match + Partial_Match × 0.8 + Semantic_Match × 0.6) / max(|Text1|, |Text2|)

Where,
• Exact_Match = Number of identical words
• Partial_Match = Number of substring matches
• Semantic_Match = Number of similar words (Levenshtein distance < 0.3)
• |Text1| = Number of words in AI response
• |Text2| = Number of words in Wikipedia text

4. Levenshtein Distance:

LD = Minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another

Where,
• Single-character edits = insertions, deletions, or substitutions
• Word similarity = 1 - (LD / max(word1_length, word2_length))

5. Final Similarity Score:

FSS = (Semantic_Score × 0.7) + (Overlap_Score × 0.3)

Where,
• FSS = Final Similarity Score (0.0 to 1.0)
• Semantic_Score = Jaccard similarity from character n-grams
• Overlap_Score = Enhanced word overlap similarity
• 0.7 = Weight for semantic method
• 0.3 = Weight for word overlap method
