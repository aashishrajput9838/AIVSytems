## Architecture

### Content Scripts
Content scripts run on supported AI platforms and capture user interactions. They monitor for new responses and send them to the background script for validation.

### Background Script
The background script handles communication between content scripts and the validation service. It manages the validation process and stores results.

### Popup UI
The popup provides a user interface to view validation results and control extension settings.

### Validation Service
The validation service communicates with the AIV Systems backend to validate AI responses using advanced algorithms.

## Development

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

```bash
cd chrome-extension
npm install

## Configuration

## Troubleshooting
