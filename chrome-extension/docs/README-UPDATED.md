## Configuration

### AIV System API Endpoint
The extension connects to the AIV System backend for validation. By default, it uses:
`http://127.0.0.1:5004/ai-reasoning-validation-system/us-central1/validateAIResponse`

To change this for production deployment:
1. Edit `background.js`
2. Modify the `apiEndpoint` variable
3. Update to your deployed Firebase Function URL

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Validation failed" or "API not accessible"
- Ensure the AIV System backend is running
- Check that the API endpoint URL is correct
- Verify network connectivity

#### Extension not capturing messages
- Make sure the extension is enabled (toggle is ON)
- Check that you're on a supported AI platform
- Try refreshing the AI chat page

#### Duplicate validations
This issue has been fixed in the updated version. If you still experience duplicates:
- Clear validation results using the "Clear" button
- Restart the browser

### Debugging
1. Open the extension popup
2. Check the browser console for error messages:
   - Right-click on the page
   - Select "Inspect"
   - Go to the "Console" tab
